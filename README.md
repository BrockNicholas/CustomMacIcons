# CustomMacIcons
Custom icons I create for my Mac when I don't like the defaults. Not for OS-installed apps

### Directions ###
1. Open Applications folder, or wherever the app is saved that you want to replace

2. Right click app and select "Get Info"

3. Drag the .icns file over the app icon in the Info window

3. (Alternatively) If you want to use a custom .png file, open the new icon in preview, CMD+A to select all, CMD+C to copy selection, click on the app icon in the Info window, CMD+V to paste the selection

4. Restart the app to see the custom icon

### To Restore ###
5. *Click the icon in the Info window and hit backspace to stop using custom icons*


## Notes ##
- The */Originals* folders contain additional files I used during creation of the .icns, such as .psd and .png files and larger resolution copies of the original artwork. 

- Any royalty free assets I used in the creation of the artwork is from pixabay.com
